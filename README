glacier-backup
==============

Encrypted backup of photos to AWS glacier. I keep my photos in a series of
directories that are named with the date and event. If you do something 
similar, then this tool can help back them up to AWS Glacier. To make it go:

* Install the boto library
* Create a vault on Glacier to store the backups (and create a IAM user
  with permissions to access it)
* Get gpg set up and add your friends gpg keys (you don't want to lose your
  photos in a HDD crash that takes out your gpg key).
* Create a ~/.glacier-backup configuration file. It is in the python 
  ini-style file format, and should look like this:
  
[backup]
rootdir=/home/me/MyPhotos
accesskey=<aws access key>
secretkey=<aws secret access key>
region=eu-west-1
vault=photos
keys=mygpgkey@example.com myfriend@example.com myotherfriend@example.com

* Run glacier-backup

The operation is simple: glacier-backup looks at all the directories under
/home/me/MyPhotos and decided whether they need backing up by looking at the 
.backupstatus file in that directory:

* If the file doesn't exist, the the directory gets backed up
* If it contains the text 'ignore' the directory is ignored (I use this to
  handle my 'incomming photos' directory).
* Otherwise it compares the files in the directory with the backup status file,
  and backs the directory up if there is anything new.
